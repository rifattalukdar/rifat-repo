            <h2>Main article: History of the Cricket World Cup</h2>
            <p>The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25
                September
                1844.[5] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and
                the
                two
                teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in
                1889.[6]
                Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition.
                Cricket
                was
                also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win
                the
                gold
                medal.[7] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.</p>
